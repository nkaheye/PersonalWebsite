        <p>
          My name is Nicolas Kayeh, but I prefer to go by Kayeh as it is the
          name I associate with the most. I used to like
          <strong>dragonboating</strong>, but oh my is it difficult. I enjoy
          playing darts, because we use plastic tips, I make sure not to throw
          the darts <em>too</em> hard.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          I am currently enrolled at BCIT in a program called Computer Information Technology <strong>(CIT)</strong>. 
          It is quite enjoyable, albeit stressful. I find myself with no social life lol and all my focus has been put towards my classes because I have no other choice.
          Unless I was okay with failing (which I am not).
